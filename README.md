# Web3 React FrontEnd Develoepr Test(Preasale App)

The project is to create a Web3 app that simulates a token presale on the Polygon Testnet. The presale has an unlimited number of stages, each with a one day duration and a token amount limit of 1,000,000 tokens. The token being sold is an ERC-20 token with symbol TSTK and 18 decimal places. The tokens can be purchased with Testnet MATIC and each wallet can buy a maximum of 10,000 tokens per stage. The price of the tokens starts at 0.00010 MATIC and increases by 0.00001 MATIC for each stage. The app displays the token amount purchased by the user and the remaining amount and price of the sale stage. There is also a countdown to the end of the stage. The app allows the user to enter the amount to buy, calculate the price to pay, and make the purchase.
